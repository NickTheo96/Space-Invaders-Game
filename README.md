# Space Invaders Game
## Outline of Project ##
This repository contains a space invaders type game I began to develop. It is at an early stage where enemies are generated and a player in the shape of a rocket is able to move around the screen using WASD keyboad controlls. It was built using the Chilli Framework. Details of the framework can be found [here](http://wiki.planetchili.net/index.php?title=Chili_Framework). The project was created in January 2017 after completing a one semester course in c++ and improved my undestanding of object oriented programming. The next step in the game would be to create a missile class which would allow the player to file missiles at the enemy.

The code which I wrote myself is within Game.cpp, Game.h, Rocket.cpp, Rocket.h within the Engine folder

## How to run the project ##

The easiest way to run the project would be to download all the files and simply open Chili Framework 2016.sln within Microsoft Visual Studio


## Description of the file structure ##

All the files are setup in the same structure as found when first downloading the framework.  Game.cpp and Game.h within the engine library are updated to create the game. Classes can be implemented within other files such as Rocket.cpp, Rocket.h which can be called in Game.cpp

## Libraries Required: ##
* Chili Framework which can be found [here](http://wiki.planetchili.net/index.php?title=Chili_Framework)
